        French roast coffee is a popular style and one that many coffee drinkers
        prefer. This dark roasted coffee has a smoky sweetness and can often
        have a charred taste. This has caused some coffee geeks to refer to it
        as a 'burnt' coffee.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Yet, how does French roast compare to other coffee beans? If you're
        looking for something a bit lighter or darker, which style should you
        choose?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        French Roast Coffee French roast coffee is one of many coffee roasts
        named for a regional roasting style. It was popular throughout much of
        Europe around the turn of the 19th century. Today, the term is used most
        often when describing almost any dark-roasted coffee.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Sometimes, French roast coffee is also referred to (colorfully) as
        Turkish roast, (incorrectly) as Espresso roast, or (simplistically) as
        Dark roast.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Trivia Time: Other regional roasts include New England roast coffee,
        Spanish roast coffee, Italian roast coffee, American roast coffee, and
        Vienna roast coffee.

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        What Does French Roast Coffee Taste Like? French roast is considered to
        be a double roast coffee. This is a category of dark roasted coffee
        characterized by an intense and smoky-sweet flavor, accompanied by a
        thin body and mouthfeel.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Compared to lighter roasts (like cinnamon light roast coffee, which is
        highly acidic), French roast coffee is far less acidic and roasted in
        flavor. It often has a charred, charcoal-like note.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dark roasts like French roast completely overpower the flavor and aroma
        nuances of the coffee beans themselves. That makes it nearly impossible
        to taste much of the origin or coffee varietal of the beans.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        To summarize, the profile of French roast coffee is:
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Intense and bold Very dark (nearly burnt, often smoky) Somewhat sweet
        Much less acidic than lighter roasts Thin in body, with a more watery
        mouthfeel than some coffees How Is French Roast Coffee Roasted? During
        the roasting process, the internal temperature of the coffee beans
        reaches a whopping 464 F (240 C).
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        As coffee roasts get "darker", the color of the coffee beans darkens and
        more coffee oils appear on the surface. In keeping with these
        characteristics, French roast coffee beans are dark brown and shimmering
        with oil.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        French roast beans are also at the end of what's called the "second
        crack." This means they are cooked with such intensity that they make
        two cracking noises during the roasting:
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        One crack comes from the release of steam. Another crack happens when
        the cell walls break down and release oils to the surface of the beans.
        In most roasts, coffee beans only crack once.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Caffeine Level Many people believe that darker roasted coffees are
        higher in caffeine than lighter roasted coffees. In fact, the opposite
        is usually true.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The longer a coffee bean is roasted, the more caffeine molecules are
        burned off. This means that if you're looking to limit your caffeine
        intake, French roast is a perfect choice.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Is French Roast Coffee Good Quality? Since it's difficult to tell what
        the original coffee beans were like before roasting, many roasters use
        less than exceptional beans for making their French roasts. Instead,
        they tend to focus on the quality of the roast itself. If the roast is
        what's important to you and you like French roast, then quality is
        subjective and you should just get what you enjoy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Many people consider French roast coffee to be nearly burnt yet still
        enjoyable (like grilled meat or dark toasted bread). Some coffee
        aficionados who prefer the taste of the beans themselves (the terroir)
        simply consider it to be burnt.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        What's Darker Than French Roast Coffee? You might see 'dark French
        roast' on some bags of coffee. This is similar to regular French roast
        but darker and oilier looking. It has a stronger charred flavor than
        regular French roast. To be sure, dark French roast coffee is a very
        dark roast, but if you're looking for something that's even darker,
        choose Spanish roast coffee. It is the darkest roast available.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        What's Lighter Than French Roast Coffee? Espresso roast is just a little
        lighter than French roast. It is the most popular roast for espresso
        shots. Lighter than that is the Full roast, a category of roasts that
        includes High roast, Continental roast, and Vienna roast.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        How Should I Brew French Roast Coffee? French roast beans are
        traditionally used for drip-brewed coffee. They also make a nice, bold
        espresso and do well when brewed in a 'French press' (aka a 'plunger
        pot').
