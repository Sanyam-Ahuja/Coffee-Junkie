        When browsing a coffee shop menu or buying a bag of coffee beans off the
        shelf, it’s important to know what makes each type of coffee special.
        You might be interested in trying something different, such as Colombian
        coffee, but hesitate out of uncertainty. It’s time to change that!
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans in the
        world; the plants thrive under the shade of banana trees in the tropical
        climate. Because of Colombia’s high altitude, it also shapes the way the
        bean grows.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        While the country produces a crazy amount of coffee, it actually exports
        a lot of its best beans. While going to Colombia for your next brew is
        an awesome idea, you can also get your hands on the beans and brew them
        at home!
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Coffee Bags Eldorado Cofffee Is Colombian Coffee Good? In short, yes,
        the unique flavors and strong aroma make Colombian coffee a fan
        favorite. So what makes it so special and desirable? When we talk about
        coffee from specific locations, we typically discuss a traditional
        method of brewing or roasting. Coffee culture is unique across the
        number of countries that love coffee all over the world. With Colombian
        coffee, we aren’t necessarily talking about a method of brewing or
        roasting, but how the bean is grown.

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Colombia is actually a near-perfect coffee growing climate, and
        Colombian coffee produces a specific type of bean that results from the
        environment. Colombia gets heavy rainfall and the landscape never gets
        close to falling below freezing temperatures at any time of the year.
        The tropical location is perfect for growing coffee, and grow it does!
        There are about 600,000 coffee growers in Colombia, and most of them
        pick the beans by hand.

      <br />
      <p>
        Of course, a lot can go wrong after the beans have been grown: they
        still need to be roasted and brewed properly, and an error in these
        processes can seriously change the taste of a Colombian cup.
        Nevertheless, when you buy Colombian coffee, you’re always off to a good
        start.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Is Colombian Coffee a Dark Roast? Not always! Colombian coffee also has
        a dark roast used to make rich espresso blends. Remember that the roast
        of the coffee isn’t actually related to the growth of the coffee.
        Colombia is famous for its coffee beans, which can be used to make both
        light roasts and dark roasts. Now, the richer and flowery flavor of
        Colombian coffee beans does make them especially suited for a dark
        roast, but light roasts made from Colombian beans are also amazing.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Is Colombian Coffee Arabica? Colombia tends to produce mostly arabica
        beans. Arabica and Robusta are the two main types of coffee beans that
        are grown in the world. The Arabica is lighter and sweeter, while
        Robusta is bolder and denser. Colombia grows mostly Arabica beans,
        giving its beans the light and flowery taste that many coffee lovers
        crave. Arabica beans make a delightful light roast, as the beans are
        already extremely flavorful and don’t need a heavy roasting process to
        bring out the taste.

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Colombian coffee is a luxury item, and makes a great gift for the coffee
        lover.

        <br />
        Coffee green fields Eldorado Coffee What is the Difference Between
        Colombian Coffee and Other Beans? What is Colombian coffee, when
        compared with regular coffee? There really isn’t such a thing as
        “regular coffee.” All coffee types are made from specific coffee beans
        grown in a different region. Colombian beans are on the higher end of
        coffee luxury, and are almost always an Arabica bean. Buying Colombian
        coffee is a commitment to higher-end coffee and more-refined taste.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Does Colombian Coffee Have More Caffeine? Colombian coffee has a
        caffeine content that is similar to beans grown elsewhere. There are a
        lot of myths and countless articles flying around the internet claiming
        that caffeine content in coffee depends on the roast. The truth is, both
        the lightest of the light roasts and the darkest of the dark roasts have
        very similar caffeine contents. Caffeine doesn’t need roasting to
        develop within the beans, and it also doesn’t break down when you begin
        to roast the beans.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        If you must know, a dark roast tends to have a bit more caffeine than a
        light roast. However, the difference is negligible, and likely won’t be
        felt. Is Colombian Coffee Stronger Than Regular Coffee? Although a
        common myth, this is not true. Colombian coffee is generally a bit
        weaker than other coffees. Colombian coffee uses Arabica, generally
        accepted as the higher-quality coffee bean. The Arabica bean is a bit
        lighter than the Robusta, so your cup of Colombian coffee will typically
        be a bit weaker than a cup made from Robusta.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Of course, coffee strength depends far more on roasting and brewing than
        it does on the beans themselves. A dark roast will leverage a bolder and
        more bitter flavor, and more grounds obviously creates a stronger cup
        than one with fewer. That being said, Colombia’s gentle coffee flavor is
        superior to some of the stronger, more bitter varieties of coffee grown
        around the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Making Colombian Coffee There isn’t really a traditional style of
        Colombian coffee, but Colombian beans are the best choice for crafting
        certain brews. The lighter, brighter flavors make the beans ideal for
        both a cup of light roast and for a rich cappuccino. Arabica beans are
        ideal for sweeter, lighter types of coffee and mixed coffee drinks. If
        you’re trying to maximize the health benefits of your coffee, try buying
        a smooth Colombian coffee and drinking it black. Cutting down on cream,
        milk, and sugar will make your coffee routine healthier.

        Looking for some summer coffee treats to try? Making iced coffee with a
        rich Colombian dark roast can give you a clean texture and rich flavor
        without the metallic bitterness that can easily creep into iced coffee.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        s Colombian Coffee Stronger Than Regular Coffee? Colombian coffee can be
        made to be stronger than regular, non-Colombian coffee, but in general
        it is typically weaker. Once you find a coffee maker to fit your
        lifestyle, experiment with lighter and darker roasts of Colombian beans
        to find a strength that suits you. The high quality of Colombian beans
        make stronger coffee that doesn’t fall apart. Lower quality beans tend
        to turn into a bitter brew at higher concentrations, but Colombian
        coffee maintains its integrity of flavor, even when pushed through more
        rigorous and intense brewing methods.

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Brewing a stronger cup of coffee at home will generally require more
        grounds and less water, but also more sophisticated brewing methods.
        Loading up your “electric pour over” (or standard coffee maker) with a
        heaping pile of grounds will give you a different cup of coffee, but may
        not be the stronger treat you want. Try a french press or slow pour over
        for a more complex and stronger flavor. You’ll be thankful you learned
        all about what is Colombian coffee!
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Final Thoughts Colombian coffee has a reputation and it definitely lives
        up to the hype. Regardless of your current coffee-consuming habits, it
        is more likely than not that you’d enjoy a cup made from the unique
        beans grown in the country.
